abstract={We investigate properties which remain invariant under the action of quasi-Möbius maps of quasi-metric spaces. A metric space is called doubling with constantDif every ball of nite radius can be cov-ered by at mostDballs of half the radius. It is shown that the doubling property is an invariant property for(quasi-)Möbius maps. Additionally it is shown that the property of uniform disconnectedness is an invariantfor (quasi-)Möbius maps as well}
