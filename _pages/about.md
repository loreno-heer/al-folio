WORK IN PROGRESS. V.2.0 WEBSITE.

<!--  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

Research Interests: Analysis in metric spaces, in particular quasiconformal, quasi-symmetric and quasi-Möbius geometry.
(Gromov\=/)hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory. Furthermore geometric analysis in general and low-dimensional topology. 
Besides pure mathematics I am interested in mathematical physics, in particular the geometry of space-time and string theory.
My current research centers on the study of the conformal horizon of de Sitter space in general relativity
with a positive cosmological constant and in particular the study of gravitational waves in this setting.
